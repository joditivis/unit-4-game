# About:
University of Denver Coding Boot Camp fourth week assignment: This assigmnet required us to create a Crystal Collector Game using JavaScript and jQuery.

# How to Play:
```
- There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

- You will be shown a random number to match at the start of the game.

- When you click on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to your total number guessed.

- The game will hide each crystals amount until you click a crystal.

- You win if your total number matches the number to match!

- You lose if your total number goes above the number to match.

- The game will restart whenever you win or lose.

- When the game begins again, you will see a new random number to match. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values.
